Customatization of the Pipeline
===============================

Introduction
------------

PP is currently undergoing a major overhaul the goal of which is to
improve the compatibility of PP with data from robotic telescopes. As
part of this overhaul, ``pp_setup`` has been introduced, which serves
as a setup file for most PP functions. By adjusting the content of
``pp_setup``, the user will be able to customize diagnostic output and
pipeline functions in order to tailor the pipeline to their needs and
data.
