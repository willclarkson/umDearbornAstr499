Photometry Pipeline Documentation
=================================

Introduction
------------

The Photometry Pipeline (PP) is a Python software package for
automated photometric analysis of imaging data from small to
medium-sized observatories. It uses `Source Extractor`_ and `SCAMP`_
to register and photometrically calibrate images based on catalogs
that are available online; photometry is measured using Source
Extractor aperture photometry. PP has been designed for asteroid
observations, but can be used with any kind of imaging data.


Scope and Applicability
-----------------------

PP has been designed to provide automated photometry for the majority
of data coming from small to medium-sized observatories. It is not
intended to provide high-accuracy photometry, nor is it designed to
work on extremely sparse or crowded fields. PP requires a field of
view of a few arcminutes to ensure that sufficient background stars
are available for registration and photometric calibration. For a
field several arcminutes across, calibrated photometric uncertaintes
are usually better than 0.05 mag, if sufficient non-saturated
background stars with cataloged brightness are available. Feel free to
try PP on your data, but please be aware that it has its limitations.

The following features are currently available as part of PP:

* automated aperture photometry based on a curve-of-growth analysis
* photometric calibration in ugriz, BVRI, JHK based on catalog coverage
* full support of moving target photometry
* target identification based on tabulated positions for fixed targets
  and moving targets, target identifier for moving targets
* support of Gaia (DR1) astrometry for image registration
* Python 2 and 3 compatibility (thanks to `boada`_)
  
Future versions of the pipeline will support newly available catalogs
for astrometry and photometry (e.g., GAIA DR2). If you are interesting
in using PP for a specific task, let me know!
